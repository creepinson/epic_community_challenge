# Epic Community Challenge
(Idea Originally from Fabric Modding Community)

###This is a Minecraft Forge mod made by everyone. You, too, can join the chaos.

##Rules: (subject to change)

No direct commits to the src directory, even if you have write access. Use pull requests.
No commenting your code. At all. You have to figure out what other people's code means!
Keep Pull Requests and commits as vague as possible. Again, others need to figure out your code.
Each person gets ONE pull request EACH WEEK containing their changes. This rule is somewhat flexible, provided good reason.
Each PR can only create ONE java file, be it a class, enum, interface or what have you. If you feel a single addition would be best suited to multiple files (BlockEntities for example), you may request permission to do so.
Each PR can, however, edit any existing java files, provided they do not change more than half of the existing lines, or add enough lines thus that the line count becomes more than twice that it was prior. This can have exceptions.
Each PR can only create ONE block texture and ONE item texture (each limited to 256x MAXIMUM).
Each PR can only create ONE of each of the other types of texture, that is guis, mobs, effects, etc. (each limited to 1024x MAXIMUM)
Each PR can add ONE sound effect (audio file shorter than 10 seconds) and ONE music track (audio file longer than 10 seconds, maximum 10 minutes)
Changing existing assets will be discouraged, but allowed provided good reason.
Any and all .json files can be added in any quantity.
No viruses, malware, spyware, adware, ransomware or any malicious code. Duh. This includes any code that runs outside code that could potentially meet any of these definitions.
No dependencies other than Minecraft Forge and Minecraft.
Attempts to circumvent these rules through means including, but not limited to, creating one massive class that does everything, creating a large number of classes within a single file, or making major changes to a class all in one line, will be moderated. (yes, this is a vague rule. it's subject to moderator's discretion)
Moderators reserve the right to reject or revert PRs at any time.
If any of these rules need further clarification, if you feel any of them are too strict or lenient, or if you feel more should be added, please let us know!

The rules can be modified only by moderators.
